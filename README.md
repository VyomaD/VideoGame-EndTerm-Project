Player can rotate and move forward/backward. Player cannot fall off the world. Camera follows player. Player and enemies use appropriate animations when moving. Once the player reaches the goal location, a "You Win" message is displayed on-screen. Enemies rotate in place looking for the player. Enemies cannot see the player through walls. Enemies will go to the player's last known position once they have been spotted. If the enemy touches the player, a "You Lose" UI message displays and the player is destroyed. If the enemy reaches the player's last known position without touching them, they return to their rotating state looking for the player.

Only the Assets/Packages/ProjectSettings folders were included in the submission.
